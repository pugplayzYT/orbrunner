# v3.1 - Launcher Hotfix
## Release Date: February 26, 2026

A quick patch to fix the launcher JAR not opening when double-clicked.

### Fixes
- **Launcher double-click fix** — The launcher JAR now opens properly when double-clicked on Windows
- Added a non-JavaFX entry point wrapper to bypass module system restrictions in fat JARs

### Technical
- New `Main.java` wrapper class that delegates to `LauncherApp.main()`
- Updated JAR manifest to use the wrapper as the main class
