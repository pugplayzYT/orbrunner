# v1.0 - The Great UI Overhaul
## Release Date: February 26, 2026

Welcome to **Maze Escape 3D v1.0** — the biggest update yet!

### What's New
- Replaced all Swing UI with in-game OpenGL rendered menus
- Added a proper **Pause Menu** with ESC key
- Mouse sensitivity, FOV, fog density, and volume sliders
- Invert Y axis toggle
- Admin panel now renders as an in-game overlay (F2)
- Game over screen rendered in-engine with frozen 3D background
- Credits on the title screen

### Fixes
- Admin panel close button now properly restores cursor and movement
- Text centering uses actual measured pixel widths instead of guesswork
- Volume slider actually controls audio volume now
- All Swing dependencies removed from the game window

### Technical
- New InGameUI class handles all menu rendering via OpenGL
- GamePanel now uses a state machine: MAIN_MENU, PLAYING, PAUSED, GAME_OVER
- FontRenderer gains getTextWidth() for proper text measurement
- InputHandler decoupled from GLFW callback registration
- SoundManager gains volume control via javax.sound.sampled MASTER_GAIN
- Build system configured for UTF-8 encoding

### Credits
A PugNet Games Production, powered by the Chad Engine.
