# v2.0 - The Runs Update
## Release Date: February 26, 2026

The Runs system lands. No more picking Easy or Hard and praying — now you name your run, choose your difficulty, and every session is saved. Come back later and pick up right where you left off, same maze and all.

### What's New
- Runs system replaces the Easy / Hard mode buttons
- Create named runs with a custom name and difficulty
- Progress auto-saves when you quit to the main menu
- Continue any in-progress run — same world seed, same maze, keys you already grabbed stay grabbed
- Completed runs are archived in the list with your finish time
- Run data saved to disk under ~/.orbCollectorGame/runs/

### Technical
- World generation is now seeded so runs are fully reproducible
- Run state persists player position, rotation, and key collection across sessions
- Runs stored as plain-text .dat files (meta.dat + state.dat per run)
