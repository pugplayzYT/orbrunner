# v3.5 - Version Uninstaller

## Release Date: February 27, 2026

Added the ability to uninstall individual game versions directly from the launcher.

### What changed

- **Uninstall button** — a new "Uninstall" button in the bottom bar lets you remove any locally cached version from your machine with a confirmation prompt
- **Smart state** — the button is only enabled when the selected version is actually installed locally, and automatically disables itself for versions that aren't downloaded
