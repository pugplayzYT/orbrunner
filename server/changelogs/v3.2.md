# v3.2 - The Padded Cell Update

## New Room Type — Padded Cell

A fourth procedurally generated room type has been added: the **Padded Cell**.

These rooms are completely empty — no furniture, no decoration. Just bare white tiled walls and floor. They are intentionally unsettling.

### What changed

- **Padded Cell rooms** now appear randomly in the world (roughly 1 in 8 of the non-special rooms)
- Walls, floor, and ceiling all use the new white tile texture
- **Horror builds faster** inside padded cells than in any other room type
- Padded cells show as **pale off-white** on the minimap, making them easy to spot and avoid — or seek out
- Tile texture is procedurally generated at build time (no external assets)
