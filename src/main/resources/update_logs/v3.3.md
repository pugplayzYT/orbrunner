# v3.3 - The Integrity Update
## Release Date: February 27, 2026

A launcher-side update that prevents silently corrupted or quietly patched
version files from being played without the player knowing.

### What changed

- **SHA-256 hash verification** — The server now computes and stores a SHA-256
  hash for every uploaded JAR. The launcher fetches these hashes alongside the
  version list and compares them against locally cached files
- **Forced reinstall on mismatch** — If your local copy of a version no longer
  matches what the server has (e.g. a silent patch was pushed without a full
  version bump), the launcher shows a **REINSTALL** button instead of PLAY and
  blocks launching until the correct file is downloaded
- **Automatic backfill** — Hashes are computed on first request for any JARs
  that were uploaded before this update, so no manual re-upload is needed
- **Pre-v3.3 installs are safe** — If the server has no hash on record for a
  version, the launcher treats it as valid and does not force a reinstall
